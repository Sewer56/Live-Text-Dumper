# Live Text Dumper

Live text dumper is a small toy program that I wrote quickly over the course of one afternoon with one quick specific purpose, allow the user to type in text at any time and save to a text file immediately, such that the content of the text could be piped into Open Broadcaster Software.

This would allow the user to create tutorials resembling the old YouTube style, should they find themselves in a lack of a microphone or not be willing to speak to the microphone.

The application also provides additional options for the exporting of the current time to a text file as well as the current song that is being played live.
